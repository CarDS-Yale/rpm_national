This repository contains the codebase used in the study titled:

**"National Patterns of Remote Patient Monitoring Service Availability at U.S. Hospitals"**

The study evaluates the presence and temporal trends in Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) service availability using U.S. hospital-level data, leveraging claims and public datasets to explore RPM adoption across settings, specialties, and patient groups.

---

## Overview

The repository includes all analytical code to generate:

1. **Cohort Construction**: Defines a national hospital cohort using the American Hospital Association annual survey data.
2. **Descriptive Tables**: Summarizes characteristics of hospitals offering RPM and the communities served by these hospitals based on county-level census data.
3. **Publication Figures**: Visualizes RPM availability and relative increase in availability across hospital/community characteristics and geography.

The repository is intended to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reuse of methodology for hospital-based health services research using administrative data.

## File Descriptions

### `cohort_creation.py`

This script assembles a cohort of U.S. hospitals reporting use of RPM services. Key tasks include:

- Identifying hospitals with documented RPM availability.
- Merging facility-level characteristics from auxiliary datasets.
- Creating analytic variables for hospital type, region, ownership, and digital infrastructure.
- Outputting a structured analytic dataset for further tabulation and plotting.

---

### `tables_rpm_national.py`

Generates descriptive statistics for the manuscript, including:

- **Table 1**: Characteristics of hospitals with RPM services according to size, region, area of location, teaching status and ownership.
- **Table 2**: Baseline characteristics of the communities served by these hospitals.

All tables are exported as CSV files, ready for review and integration into the publication.

---

### `figures_plots_rpm_national.py`

Produces the visualizations in the manuscript, including:

- **Figure 1**: Relative increase in RPM availability from 2018 to 2022.
- **Figure 2**: Geographic map of RPM availability by county.
- **Figure 3**: Community and hospital characteristics associated with the availability of RPM services.
- **Figure 4**: Trends in the proportion of hospitalizations for HF and AMI at hospitals with and without RPM.
- **Figure 5**: Trends in RPM service availability by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) classification.
.

Figures are generated using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `geopandas`, and saved as high-resolution PNGs.

## Requirements & Setup

### Environment

The analysis requires Python 3.8+ and the following Python packages:

```
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
geopandas
```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rpm_national.git
   cd rpm_national
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Adjust input paths and filenames as needed within each script to match your data environment.
